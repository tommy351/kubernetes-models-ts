                    discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                    embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                    fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                    ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                    actual usage.  2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                    add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                    usages, there are particular     restrictions like, \"must
                    refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or
                    \"name must be restricted\".     Those cannot be well
                    described when embedded.  3. Inconsistent
                    validation.  Because the usages are different, the
                    validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard
                    for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields are
                    both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during
                    interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                    the dependency is on the group,resource tuple     and the
                    version of the actual struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot
                    easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many
                    locations, updates to this type     will affect numerous
                    schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API
                    type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on
                    your reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission
